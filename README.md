# **Noshly – Food Rescue Platform**  

## **Overview**  
Millions go hungry while **1.3 billion tons of food** are wasted every year. Noshly provides a **seamless way for restaurants, individuals, and food businesses to donate surplus food**, ensuring it reaches food banks, NGOs, and organizations in need. By reducing food waste, we help **fight hunger, minimize environmental impact, and promote sustainability**.  

## **How It Works**  
1. **List Surplus Food** – Donors upload food details, including descriptions and servings.  
2. **Food Banks Connect** – Registered organizations browse and claim available food.  
3. **Easy Pickup** – Organizations arrange direct pickup from donors.  
4. **Rewards for Giving** – Donors earn badges, points, and recognition for contributions.  

## **Key Features**  
- Real-time food donation listings  
- Direct communication between donors and recipients  
- Recognition & rewards for contributors  
- Efficient, sustainable food distribution
